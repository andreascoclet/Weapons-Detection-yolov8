# Weapons-Detection-yolov8

### Solution Overview
A web service with the capability to upload videos/photos for detecting the presence of weapons and armed individuals, along with calculating the confidence level in the presence of such elements in the image.

Solution Stack:
- Python, React, Fast API.
- YOLOv8m.
- Roboflow.

To prepare the service, we:

- Gathered data from open sources.
- Annotated images, highlighting bounding boxes for weapons and people with weapons.
- Implemented algorithms for geometric analysis and corrected distortions in the images.
- Performed augmentation (artificially increased the number of images).
- Trained the YoloV8 med model.
- Developed a React frontend.
- Integrated FastApi.
- Created instructions for connecting external cameras to our service.

The web service includes machine corrections for various camera distortions and the ability to provide feedback on the model's performance.

### Solution Structure
- The file `solution.py` is the main file, where models are initialized, inference is performed, and predictions are formatted.
- The file `model.py` contains the code responsible for model inference.

### Building the Solution üê≥
To get started, you need to install Docker üê≥. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once Docker is installed and verified, you can build the current baseline. Run the following command from the project's root directory:
```bash
docker build -t urbancode-baseline .
